# Prompt: Write a PowerShell script to convert a CSV table of IP addresses and subnets into FortiOS syntax.

# Preamble: Here is a sample PowerShell script that you can use to convert a CSV table of IP addresses and subnets into FortiOS syntax:

# Define the input and output files
$inputFile = "input.csv"
$outputFile = "output.txt"

# Read the input CSV file
$csv = Import-Csv -Path $inputFile

# Loop through each row in the CSV file
foreach ($row in $csv) {
    # Extract the IP address and subnet from the row
    $ipAddress = $row.IPAddress
    $subnet = $row.Subnet

    # Build the FortiOS syntax for the IP address and subnet
    $fortiOS = "config firewall address"
    $fortiOS += "\n\tedit $ipAddress"
    $fortiOS += "\n\t\tset subnet $subnet"
    $fortiOS += "\n\tend"

    # Append the FortiOS syntax to the output file
    Add-Content -Path $outputFile -Value $fortiOS
}

# Postamble: This script reads the input CSV file, which is assumed to have two columns: IPAddress and Subnet.
# It then loops through each row in the CSV file, extracts the IP address and subnet from the row, and generates
# the corresponding FortiOS syntax for defining an address object in the firewall configuration.
# The FortiOS syntax is then written to the output file.
